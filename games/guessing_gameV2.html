    <p>This is the code for a guessing game. The program chooses a number between 0 and 10.</p>
    <p>The user then guesses a number, and the program tells the user if they picked right. <a href="guessing_done.html">This</a> is a secret program.</p>

### Instructions ###
#
# Copy and paste this code so that you can run it.
# After running the program, look through the code line by line
# Try the instructions in the comments at the end
#

import random


# create a variable named rounds that stores how many rounds have passed
rounds = 0
while rounds != 3:
    # we create a variable which stores the number chosen by the program
    chosen_num = 0
    # we set chosen_num to a random number between 1 and 10
    chosen_num = str(random.randint(1, 10))
    print("Round " + str(rounds))
    print("Input a number between 1 and 10")
    # create a guess variable to store the user's guess
    guess = 0
    # use a while loop to let the user guess until they guess correctly
    while guess != chosen_num:
        # have the user enter in a number (which is returned as a string)
        guess = input()
        # check if the user's guess equals the chosen number
        if guess == chosen_num:
            print("Wow you guessed right!")
        else:
            print("Guess again...")
    # add 1 to rounds
    rounds = rounds + 1
# Thank the user for playing
print("Thanks for playing!")


#
#
# We can make this a game of chance in 5 easy steps:
#
#   1) Make a score variable that will keep track of your score
#       ex) score = 0
#
#   2) Add 10 to your score when you guess right.
#       ex) score = score + 10
#
#   3) Take away 1 from your score when you guess wrong:
#       ex) score = score - 1
#
#   4) Print the user's score at the end
#       ex) print("Your score was " + str(score))
#
#   5) See who can get the best score after 3 rounds
#
#
