    <p>This is the game of Pigs!</p>
    <p>On your turn, roll a 6 sided die. Add what you roll to your score for that round.</p>
    <p>You can keep rolling to add to your round score.</p>
    <p>If you roll a 1, you get zero points for the round, and your turn is over.</p>
    <p>You may choose to end your turn and add your round points to your total score.</p>
    <p>The first person to 100 points, wins.</p>
