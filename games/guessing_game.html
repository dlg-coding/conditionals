    <p>This is the code for a guessing game. The program chooses a number between 0 and 10.</p>
    <p>The user then guesses a number, and the program tells the user if they picked right.</p>

### Instructions ###
#
# Copy and paste this code so that you can run it.
# After running the program, modify the code so that it keeps running until you guess right.
# Hint: You'll need to use a while loop to accomplish this.

# have the user enter in a number (which is returned as a string)
guess = input("Guess which number I picked: ")
# turn guess into an integer using the int() function.
