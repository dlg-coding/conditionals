    <p>This is the code for a guessing game. The program chooses a number between 0 and 10.</p>
    <p>The user then guesses a number, and the program tells the user if they picked right.</p>

### Instructions ###
#
# Copy and paste this code so that you can run it.
# After running the program, look through the code line by line
# Try the instructions in the comments at the end
#

import random

start_num = 1
end_num = 10
# we create a variable named chosen_num
chosen_num = 0
# we set chosen_num to a random number between 1 and 10
chosen_num = random.randint(start_num, end_num)
print("I picked a number between " + str(start_num) + " and " + str(end_num) + ".")
# create a guess variable to store the user's guess
guess = 0
# have the user enter in a number (which is returned as a string)
guess = input("Guess which number I picked: ")
# turn guess into an integer using the int() function.
guess = int(guess)
# check if the user's guess equals the chosen number
if guess == chosen_num:
    print("Wow you guessed right!")
else:
    print("Sorry, that's not the number I picked.")

#
#
# We can make this more interesting in 5 easy steps:
#
#   1) Use a while loop that lets you keep guessing until you guess right.
#       ex) while guess != chosen_num:
#               guess = input()
#
#   2) Use a variable that stores the round. Rounds end after you guess right.
#       2a) Create a variable named rounds
#           ex) rounds = 0
#       2b) Add one when you guess right.
#           ex) if guess == chosen_num:
#           ex)    rounds = rounds + 1
#
#   3) Use a while loop, so you can play 3 rounds
#       ex) while rounds != 3 
#
#   4) Use a variable that stores your score. 
#       4a) Create a variable named score
#           ex) score = 0
#       4b) Add 5 when you guess right.
#           ex) if guess == chosen_num:
#           ex)     score = score + 5
#       4c) Subtract 1 when you guess wrong.
#           ex) score = score - 1
#
#   5) See who can get the best score after 3 rounds
#
#
