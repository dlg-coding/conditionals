    <p>This is the code for a guessing game. The program chooses a number between 1 and 1000.</p>
    <p>The user then guesses a number, and the program tells the user if they picked right.</p>
    <p>The program tells the user if they guessed too high or too low.</p>
    <p>There is a way to play this such that you always guess right using 10 guesses at most.</p>
